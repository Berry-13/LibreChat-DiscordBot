>‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: When using this bot, exercise caution with command permissions. It is strongly recommended to limit bot command permissions to yourself or trusted individuals. We advise using the bot on a private discord server to minimize risks. This precaution is crucial as certain commands allow manipulating the .env file, and have the potential to expose sensitive API keys.
